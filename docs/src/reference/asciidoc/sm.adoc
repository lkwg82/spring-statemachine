[[sm-config]]
== Statemachine Configuration
One of the common tasks when using a Statemachine is to design its
runtime configuration. This chapter will focus on how Spring
Statemachine is configured and how it leverages Spring's lightweight
IoC containers to simplify the application internals to make it more
manageable.

[NOTE]
====
Configuration examples in this section are not feature complete, i.e.
you always need to have definitions of both states and transitions,
otherwise state machine configuration would be ill-formed. We have
simply made code snippets less verbose by leaving other needed parts
away.
====

=== Configuring States
We'll get into more complex configuration examples a bit later but
lets first start with a something simple. For most simple state
machine you just use `EnumStateMachineConfigurerAdapter` and define
possible states, choose initial and optional end state.

=== Configuring Hierarchical States
Hierarchical states can be defined by using multiple `withStates()`
calls where `parent()` can be used to indicate that these
particular states are sub-states of some other state.

----
include::samples/DocsConfigurationSampleTests.java[tags=snippetB]
----

=== Configuring Regions

There are no special configuration methods to mark a collection of
states to be part of an orthogonal state. To put it simple, orthogonal
state is created when same hierarchical state machine has multiple set
of states each having a initial state. Because an individual state
machine can only have one initial state, multiple initial states must
mean that a specific state must have multiple independent regions.

----

=== Configuring Transitions
We support three different types of transitions, `external`,
`internal` and `local`. Transitions are either triggered by a signal
which is an event sent into a state machine or a timer.

include::samples/DocsConfigurationSampleTests.java[tags=snippetC]
----

=== Configuring Guards
Guards are used to protect state transitions. Interface _Guard_ is
used to do an evaluation where method has access to a _StateContext_.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::samples/DocsConfigurationSampleTests.java[tags=snippetD]
----

In above two different types of guard configurations are used. Firstly a
simple _Guard_ is created as a bean and attached to transition between
states `S1` and `S2`.

Secondly a simple spel expression can be used as a guard where
expression must return a `BOOLEAN` value. Behind a scenes this spel
based guard is a _SpelExpressionGuard_. This was attached to
transition between states `S2` and `S3`. Both guard in above sample
always evaluate to true.

=== Configuring Actions
Actions can be defined with various steps within a state transitions.

include::samples/DocsConfigurationSampleTests.java[tags=snippetE]
----

=== Configuring Pseudo States

_Pseudo state_ configuration is usually done by configuring states and
transitions. Pseudo states are automatically added to state machine as
states.

==== Initial State
Simply mark a particular state as initial state by using `initial()`
method. There are two methods where one takes extra argument to define
an initial action. This initial action is good for example initialize
extended state variables. 

(*Hint:* As the statemachine is not fully initialised yet, the initial action can not be used to emit events. This could be done with an entry action for the initial state.)

----

==== Terminate State
Simply mark a particular state as end state by using `end()` method.
This can be done max one time per individual sub-machine or region.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::samples/DocsConfigurationSampleTests.java[tags=snippetA]
----

==== History State
History state can be defined once for each individual state machine.
You need to choose its state identifier and `History.SHALLOW` or
`History.DEEP` respectively.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::samples/DocsConfigurationSampleTests.java[tags=snippetR]
----

==== Choice State
Choice needs to be defined in both states and transitions to work
properly. Mark particular state as choice state by using `choice()`
method. This state needs to match source state when transition is
configured for this choice.

Transition is configured using `withChoice()` where you define source
state and `first/then/last` structure which is equivalent to normal
`if/elseif/else`. With `first` and `then` you can specify a guard just
like you'd use a condition with `if/elseif` clauses.

Transition needs to be able to exist so make sure `last` is used.
Otherwise configuration is ill-formed.

include::samples/DocsConfigurationSampleTests.java[tags=snippetS]
----

==== Fork State
Fork needs to be defined in both states and transitions to work
properly. Mark particular state as choice state by using `fork()`
method. This state needs to match source state when transition is
configured for this fork.

Target state needs to be a super state or immediate states in
regions. Using a super state as target will take all regions into
initial states. Targeting individual state give more controlled entry
into regions.

----
include::samples/DocsConfigurationSampleTests.java[tags=snippetT]
----

==== Join State
Join needs to be defined in both states and transitions to work
properly. Mark particular state as choice state by using `join()`
method. This state doesn't need to match either source states or
target state in a transition configuration.

Select one target state where transition goes when all source states
has been joined. If you use state hosting regions as source, end
states of a regions are used as joins. Otherwise you can pick any
states from a regions.

[[sm-factories]]
== State Machine Factories
There are use cases when state machine needs to be created dynamically
instead of defining static configuration at compile time. For example
if there are custom components which are using its own state machines
and these components are created dynamically it is impossible to have
a static state machined build during the application start. Internally
state machines are always build via a factory interfaces and this then
gives user an option to use this feature programmatically.
Configuration for state machine factory is exactly same as you've seen
in various examples in this document where state machine configuration
is hard coded.

Actually creating a state machine using _@EnableStateMachine_ will
work via factory so _@EnableStateMachineFactory_ is merely exposing
that factory via its interface.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::samples/DocsConfigurationSampleTests.java[tags=snippetF]
----

Now that you've used _@EnableStateMachineFactory_ to create a factory
instead of a state machine bean, it can be injected and used as is to
request new state machines.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::samples/DocsConfigurationSampleTests.java[tags=snippetL]
----

=== Factory Limitations
Current limitation of factory is that all actions and guard it is
associating with created state machine will share a same instances.
This means that from your actions and guard you will need to
specifically handle a case that same bean will be called by a different
state machines. This limitation is something which will be resolved in
future releases.

[[sm-actions]]
== Using Actions
Actions are one of the most useful components from user perspective to
interact and collaborate with a state machine. Actions can be executed
in various places in a state machine and its states lifecycle like
entering or exiting states or during a transitions.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::samples/DocsConfigurationSampleTests.java[tags=snippetVA]
----

Above `action1` and `action2` beans are attached to states entry and
exit respectively.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::samples/DocsConfigurationSampleTests.java[tags=snippetVD]
----

You can directly implement _Action_ as an anonymous function or create
a your own implementation and define appropriate implementation as a
bean.

In `action3` a SpEL expression is used to send event *Events.E1* into
a state machine.

[NOTE]
====
_StateContext_ is described in section <<sm-statecontext>>.
====

=== SpEL Expressions with Actions 
It is also possible to use SpEL expressions as a replacement for a
full _Action_ implementation.

[[sm-guards]]
== Using Guards
Above `guard1` and `guard2` beans are attached to states entry and
exit respectively.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::samples/DocsConfigurationSampleTests.java[tags=snippetVB]
----

You can directly implement _Guard_ as an anonymous function or create
a your own implementation and define appropriate implementation as a
bean. In above sample `guardExpression` is simply checking if extended
state variable `myvar` evaluates to _TRUE_.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::samples/DocsConfigurationSampleTests.java[tags=snippetVC]
----

[NOTE]
====
_StateContext_ is described in section <<sm-statecontext>>.
====

=== SpEL Expressions with Guards
It is also possible to use SpEL expressions as a replacement for a
full _Guard_ implementation. Only requirement is that expression needs
to return a *Boolean* value to satisfy _Guard_ implementation. This is
demonstrated with a _guardExpression()_ function which takes an
expression as an argument.

[[sm-statecontext]]
== Using StateContext
_StateContext_ is a domain object representing a current status of a
state machine within a transition or an action. Context gives an
access to a various information like event, message headers, extended
state variables, current transition and a top-level state machine in
case there is a need to send events to a further processing.

[[sm-triggers]]
== Triggering Transitions
Driving a statemachine is done via transitions which are triggered
by triggers. Currently supported triggers are _EventTrigger_ and
_TimerTrigger_.

=== EventTrigger
_EventTrigger_ is the most useful trigger because it allows user to
directly interact with a state machine by sending events to it. These
events are also called signals. Trigger is added to a transition simply
by associating a state to it during a configuration.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::samples/DocsConfigurationSampleTests.java[tags=snippetO]
----
In above example we send an event using two different ways. Firstly we
simply sent a type safe event using state machine api method
`sendEvent(E event)`. Secondly we send event wrapped in a Spring
messaging _Message_ using api method `sendEvent(Message<E> message)`
with a custom event headers. This allows user to add arbitrary extra
information with an event which is then visible to _StateContext_ when
for example user is implementing actions.

=== TimerTrigger
_TimerTrigger_ is useful when something needs to be triggered
automatically without any user interaction. Trigger is added to a
transition by associating a timer to it during a configuration.

[[sm-listeners]]
== Listening State Machine Events
There are use cases where you just want to know what is happening with
a state machine, react to something or simply get logging for
debugging purposes. SSM provides interfaces for adding listeners which
then gives an option to get callback when various state changes,
actions, etc are happening.

You basically have two options, either to listen Spring application
context events or directly attach listener to a state machine. Both of
these basically will provide same information where one is producing
events as event classes and other producing callbacks via a listener
interface. Both of these have pros and cons which will be discussed later.

=== Application Context Events
Application context events classes are _OnTransitionStartEvent_,
_OnTransitionEvent_, _OnTransitionEndEvent_, _OnStateExitEvent_,
_OnStateEntryEvent_, _OnStateChangedEvent_, _OnStateMachineStart_ and
_OnStateMachineStop_. These can be used as is with spring typed
_ApplicationListener_ class but they also share a common class
_StateMachineEvent_ which can be used to get statemachine related
events.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::samples/DocsConfigurationSampleTests.java[tags=snippetG]
----

=== State Machine Listener
Using _StateMachineListener_ you can either extend it and
implement all callback methods or use _StateMachineListenerAdapter_
class which contains stub method implementations and choose which ones
to override.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::samples/DocsConfigurationSampleTests.java[tags=snippetH]
----

In above example we simply created our own listener class
_StateMachineEventListener_ which extends
_StateMachineListenerAdapter_.

Once you have your own listener defined, it can be registered into a
state machine via its interface as shown below. It's just a matter of
flavour if it's hooked up within a spring configuration or done
manually at any time of application life-cycle.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::samples/DocsConfigurationSampleTests.java[tags=snippetM]
----

=== Limitations and Problems
Spring application context is not a fastest event bus out there so it
is advised to give some thought what is a rate of events state machine
is sending. For better performance it may be better to use
_StateMachineListener_ interface. For this specific reason it is
possible to use `contextEvents` flag with _@EnableStateMachine_ and
_@EnableStateMachineFactory_ to disable Spring application context
events as shown above.

include::samples/DocsConfigurationSampleTests.java[tags=snippetN]
----

[[sm-context]]
== Context Integration
It is a little limited to do interaction with a state machine by
either listening its events or using actions with states and
transitions. Time to time this approach would be too limited and
verbose to create interaction with the application a state machine is
working with. For this specific use case we have made a spring style
context integration which easily attach state machine functionality
into your beans.

=== Annotation Support
_@WithStateMachine_ annotation can be used to associate a state
machine with a existing bean. Withing this annotation a propertys
_source_ and _target_ can be used to qualify a transition 

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::samples/DocsConfigurationSampleTests.java[tags=snippetI]
----

Default _@OnTransition_ annotation can't be used with a state and
event enums user have created due to java language limitations, thus
string representation have to be used.

However if you want to have a type safe annotation it is possible to
create a new annotation and use _@OnTransition_ as meta annotation.
This user level annotation can make a reference to actual states and
events enums and framework will try to match these in a same way.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::samples/DocsConfigurationSampleTests.java[tags=snippetJ]
----

Above we created a _@StatesOnTransition_ annotation which defines
`source` and `target` as a type safe manner.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::samples/DocsConfigurationSampleTests.java[tags=snippetK]
----

In your own bean you can then use this _@StatesOnTransition_ as is and
use type safe `source` and `target`.
